intro: |
  A project to design a catalogue for graduates of the Textile Design course
  (2013) at Falmouth University. I was asked to create something that did not
  favour any one graduate’s work over another. For the cover I came up with the
  idea of using fine set typography and different tactile materials like clear
  acetate and a varying thickness of paper — without actually showing any work
  — to create a delicate sense of texture and layering, which mirrors the
  delicate weave and material of textile work.
