intro: |
  Neural  oscillations  reflect  fluctuations in  excitability,  which  biases the  percept of  ambiguous  sensory input.  Why  this  bias  occurs  is  still  not  fully  understood. We  hypothesized that  neural  populations representing likely  events  are  more  sensitive, and thereby become active  on earlier oscillatory  phases, when the ensemble itself is less excitable. Perception of ambiguous input presented during less-excitable phases should therefore be biased towards frequent  or predictable stimuli that  have lower  activation thresholds. Here, we show with computational modelling, psychophysics, and magnetoencephalography such  a  frequency  bias  in  spoken  word  recognition;   a computational  model  matched the  double dissociation found with MEG, where the  phase of oscillations  in  the superior  temporal  gyrus  (STG) and medial  temporal  gyrus  (MTG)  biased  word-identification  behavior  based  on  phoneme and  lexical frequencies, respectively.  These  results  demonstrate  that  oscillations  provide  a  temporal  ordering  of neural activity based on the sensitivity of separable neural populations.
