intro: |
  The Sound of Thunder is a handmade book featuring an illustrated exploration
  into the experience I had of going to a Mötorhead gig. The design intends to
  portray the juxstapostion between the superficial calmness of the venue's
  exterior and the atmosphere of chaos of the events inside by using a mix of
  textures, materials, typography and photography.
