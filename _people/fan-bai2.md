bio: I am a postdoctoral researcher in the group of Language and Computation in Neural Systems (LaCNS). Using MEEG, my research mainly focuses on the neural mechanisms of speech segmentation and syntactic representation. Supervised by and worked together with Andrea Martin and Antje Meyer at Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics and Donders Centre for Cognitive Neuroimaging, I obtained my PhD from Radboud University.
