bio: I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Language and Computation in Neural Systems Group at MPI. I am interested in the general language ability of human, and I studies this ability through any possible methods. I focus on the topic of cognitive units in language and how people process these units. In my previous research, I discovered a two-stage processing for cognitive units and developed a computational model, Less-is-Better, to segment the cognitive units in linguistic materials unsupervisedly. During my postdoctoral work, I will continue to study cognitive units and investigate the relationship between cognitive units and brain oscillations. In addition, I want to discover how human language emerges by modeling it in complex systems.
