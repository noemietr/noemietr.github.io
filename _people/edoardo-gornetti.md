bio: I am a PhD student based at the MPI for Psycholinguistics, working under the supervision of Andrea Martin and Stephanie Forkel. I have a bachelor’s degree in Psychology from the university of Milano-Bicocca, and a master’s degree in Neuropsychology. I have previously worked on the functional lateralisation of the reading network in the brain. My main research interest lies in how variability in behaviour and cognition is linked to variability in brain activity and structure. In my PhD project, I therefore aim at combining behavioural, functional (e.g., EEG, MEG), and structural methods (e.g., tractography) to better address the issue of individual variability, notably in spoken and written language processing.
