bio: I am a PhD student at the <a href="https://www.mpi.nl/department/psychology-language/5" target="blank">Psychology of Language</a> department at the MPI, supervised by <a href="https://www.mpi.nl/people/meyer-antje" target="blank">Antje Meyer</a> and Andrea Martin. I use electrophysiological methods to track neural dynamics of language and speech production, in order to inform theories of spoken language production. In the initial project of my dissertation, we investigate  issues arising at the intersection between Psycholinguistics and speech motor control. Specifically, we assess whether the monitoring of speech is sensitive to the frequency of syllable-sized representations. These effects stand to inform us about the tradeoff between stored versus assembled representations for setting sensory targets in the production of speech.
