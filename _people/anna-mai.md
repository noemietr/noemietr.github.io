bio: I am a postdoctoral researcher studying formal phonology and the neural representation of speech sounds. In the past, I have worked on the production of linguistic prosody in English and Ja'a Kumiai, the computational properties of tone and vowel harmony systems, and the formal properties of phonological theories. For my dissertation, I used intracranial EEG to investigate how speech acoustics support language-specific phonological processing, and in the LaCNS group, I hope to build off this work to study how sensory signals become language in the brain.
