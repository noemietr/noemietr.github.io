bio: I am a PhD student of Max Planck School of Cognition, currently working at LaCNS research group. I am most interested in neural representations of syntax and its interaction with other representational linguistics levels. For the first part of my PhD research, I am working on a MEG dataset for naturalistic speech comprehension, trying to evaluate the role of prediction and brain rhythm modulation at the lexical dimension. I obtained bachelors in Cognitive Sciences and a masters at the Generative Linguistics department, both at University of SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil.
