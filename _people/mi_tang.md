bio: I am a 3rd-year PhD student based at the University of Groningen (RUG). I will be in the Language and Computation in Neural Systems group as a visiting student to work with Andrea Martin. My PhD project looks at lexical tone representation and is co-supervised by Jennifer Spenader and Stephen Jones in RUG. I'm especially interested in the questions of to what extent the brain represents lexical tones hierarchically and the possibility to reconstruct the EEG signals elicited by tonal stimuli using the method of Temporal Response Function.
